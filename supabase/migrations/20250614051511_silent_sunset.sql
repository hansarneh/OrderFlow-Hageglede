  # Fix billing_address column to show clean address format

  1. Problem
    - billing_address column contains full JSON objects
    - Need to show only formatted address: "address_1\npostcode city"

  2. Solution
    - Backup original JSON data to billing_address_json column
    - Convert billing_address column from jsonb to text
    - Extract and format address data properly

  3. Result
    - billing_address will show: "HÃ¸ybakkveien 3\n1540 Vestby"
    - Original data preserved in billing_address_json
